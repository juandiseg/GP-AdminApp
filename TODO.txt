TO DO:
------------------
mainShifts.java	    -> 	Late entries highlights.	(Formatting and restricting entries)

generateReport.java ->  Check dates which make sense.

CHECK LENGTH OF SUCCESSLABEL BEFORE IT PUSHES DELETE BUTTON

WHEN PRODUCT IS EDITTED THE TOP LABEL DOESNT CHANGE

TESTING
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    15% --> Interface. Technical Part (input restrictions) & Usability Testing.
    85% --> Database - Many requests incoming into the DB (), record delay.
        |
    85% |-> backend - performance, reaction times, double-prove calculations. 

j unit test - >> backend
unit testing -> testing a single component
integration testing -> testing how mutilple components interact
manual testing probably good for interface.
automatic testing probably good for back-end stuff.
