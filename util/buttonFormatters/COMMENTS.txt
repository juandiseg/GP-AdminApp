The functioning of buttonFormatters consists of every type of button having its own formatter
which takes the implementation of an interface and the button that's to be formatter as arguments.

This comes very useful, as most buttons follow a similar logic but with small differences among them.
The implementation of an interface the formatter requires holds the methods which are required for that certain button type.
E.g.: the iEditButton interface checks for placeholders and valid inputs, meanwhile the iAuxButton only holds the action of the button.

This is very useful as their appareance is also set by their formatters, making it really simple to change the look of any 
category of buttons. This also simplifies the possible implementation settings such as dark mode of color blind options, as well
as assuring that all necessary steps are being followed for each button "action".
