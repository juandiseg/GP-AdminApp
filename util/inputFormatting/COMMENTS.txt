The functioning of inputFormatters consists of generalizing and allowing to reuse the logic behind restricting input.

These formatters take a JTextField and apply the respective key listeners in order to make visible to the user what
the expected format for the input is, as well as restricting invalid input.

E.g.As every time a field to be filled with a date the exact same logic is applied, so it makes sense for this logic
to be implemented in its own class.

These formatters can be accessed through a factory, as there could be some further formatters added in the system if
new input 'types' are there to be needed in the future.
