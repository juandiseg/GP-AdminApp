The functioning of listenersFormatters consists of generalizing and allowing to reuse the logic behind focus listeners.

These take a JTextField or a JToggleButton and apply te respective focus listeners and visual cues (such as changing
the color of the text) in order to make visible to the user whether their input is filled completly/valid.

E.g.As every time a field to be filled with a date the exact same logic is applied, so it makes sense for this logic
to be implemented in its own class.

It was not possible to have a factory for these formatters to be accessed through as each formatter requires different arguments.
